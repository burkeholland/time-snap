# YouTube Frame Snap (MVP Skeleton)

This is the initial scaffold (Step 1 of the implementation plan) for a Chrome (Manifest V3) extension that captures the current frame of a YouTube video and downloads it as an image.

## Current Status
- Manifest with host permission for YouTube.
- Content script + stylesheet placeholders (no functional button yet).
- Icons directory contains placeholder PNG files (replace with real icons before distribution).

## Planned Steps (Summarized)
1. (Done) Skeleton & manifest.
2. DOM injection utilities.
3. SPA navigation observer.
4. Frame capture (canvas) core logic.
5. Toast / feedback UI.
6. Styling for button + toast (dark/light aware).
7. Edge case guards (DRM, readiness, large res, etc.).
8. Manual QA scenarios.
9. Documentation polish & disclaimer.
10. Future feature hooks (options, shortcuts, clipboard).

Full detailed plan lives in `docs/youtube-frame-capture-extension-plan.md`.

## Development (Load Unpacked)
1. Open Chrome: `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer Mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the repo root (folder containing `manifest.json`).
4. Navigate to a YouTube watch page and open DevTools console to verify no errors.

(As of Step 1 the extension does not yet inject a button.)
